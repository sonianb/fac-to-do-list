# _To-Do or Not To-Do?_

A to-do list project with an emphasis on automated testing, by [Sonia](https://github.com/sonianb) and [Joe](https://github.com/joe-dev-public).

## How to use it

- [Visit the deployed site here](https://sonianb.github.io/fac-to-do-list/)
- Enter text of a task you'd like to add to your list
- Press enter/return or click "Add task"
- Your task is added to the list
- You can add as many tasks as you like
- If you want to mark a task as done, click the checkbox to the left of the task in the list
- If you want to delete a task, click the (-) button to the right of the task in the list
- If you want to hide your completed tasks, check the box above the list labelled "Hide completed tasks"

### Tests

## Known issues

## Project brief

Build a to-do list tracker that allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks from a list. Automated tests should cover all the main user stories and the rest of the code.

(Original brief here: https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-apprenticeship/testing/project/)

### User stories

1. As a busy person, I want to:
 - Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
 - Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
 - Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

2. As a motor-impaired user, I want to:
 - Use all the features of the app without a mouse

3. As a busy person, I want to:
 - Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

### Acceptance Criteria
- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure app is accessible to as many different users as possible
