# To-Do List Tracker
Project brief: build a to-do list tracker that allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks from a list. Automated tests should cover all the main user stories and the rest of the code.

## User stories

1. As a busy person, I want to:
 - Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
 - Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
 - Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

2. As a motor-impaired user, I want to:
 - Use all the features of the app without a mouse

3. As a busy person, I want to:
 - Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

## Acceptance Criteria
- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure app is accessible to as many different users as possible
